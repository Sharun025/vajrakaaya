# Vercel Deployment Status

## Latest Fix Applied
- Fixed `.vercelignore` to keep `apps/web` directory
- Only ignoring build artifacts, not source code
- Ready for deployment

## Current Configuration
- Build Command: `cd apps/web && npm run build`
- Output Directory: `apps/web/.next`
- Framework: Next.js

## Expected Result
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ App deploys and is accessible
- ✅ Login works with demo credentials
