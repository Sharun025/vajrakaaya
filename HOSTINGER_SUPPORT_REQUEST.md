**Subject:** Need Node.js Configuration for Next.js Application Deployment

**Message:**

Hello Hostinger Support Team,

I need help configuring my hosting for a Node.js/Next.js application deployment.

**Repository Details:**
- Repository: https://github.com/Sharun025/vajrakaaya
- Branch: master
- Application Type: Next.js 14 (Node.js application)

**Current Issue:**
My deployment is failing because Hostinger is looking for PHP/Composer files instead of recognizing this as a Node.js project. The deployment ends immediately after checking for composer.lock/composer.json files.

**Required Configuration:**
Please configure my hosting for Node.js deployment with the following settings:

1. **Runtime:** Node.js 18.x or higher
2. **Build Command:** `npm run hostinger:build`
3. **Output Directory:** `apps/web/.next`
4. **Install Command:** `npm install`
5. **Start Command:** `npm run hostinger:start`

**Environment Variables Needed:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/production.db
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://my-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=my-production-secret
```

**Project Structure:**
This is a monorepo with the Next.js application in the `apps/web` directory.

**Files in Repository:**
- `package.json` (root with Node.js scripts)
- `apps/web/package.json` (Next.js application)
- `.hostinger` (deployment configuration)
- `nodejs.json` (Node.js runtime config)

Please help me configure the hosting environment for Node.js deployment.

Thank you!
